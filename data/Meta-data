# Some notes about individual images
Ore 03045  the landmarks 8 and 9 sometimes meet the margin in odd ways, may want to exclude them from the analysis

Ore 10413 Many veins do not intersect properly with wing. Specifically lm1,8, and 9
Landmark 8 should be ok for analysis, but exclude 1 and 9. The phenotypes of landmark 9 is similar to that found for Ore 03045. The  mini vein that sometimes appears between the posterior crossveins is enhanced in Ore10413.

Ore 11191 Landmark number 9 forks occasionally. Try the analysis with and without this landmark.

Ore 14403 Landmark one bends sometimes so that it is parallel to the margin 9 and does not meet it). ~4 samples. Try analysis with and without this landmark.

Sam 14189 (rep 2) ~10% of P element individuals have a forked vein for LM9

REP2

In general REP2 Oregon flies show some strange LM 1and LM 9 issues

Ore 3045 rep2 extra vein material around LM 8, and 9 shows an uncharacteristic bend.
 Worse in males where there is severe notching at margin, with additional vein material. Lm has extra vein material in some samples.

Ore 10413 , Lm1,Lm9 and to a lesser extent LM8 all have problems (wandering veins, extra vein material, and not meeting the margin). Lm8 (and possibly lm9 ) is probably ok to use.
